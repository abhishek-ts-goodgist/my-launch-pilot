1. Use the existing Typography component from src/components/ui for any typography-related elements while generating components.

2. All ShadCN UI components must be placed under src/components/ui.

3. All application-specific components (non-ShadCN) should be placed under src/components/app, organized by feature or purpose.

4. Structure directories under components/app based on functionality — e.g.:

    4.1. Place sidebar-related components in components/app/sidebar

    4.2. Place authentication-related components in components/app/auth

5. Enforce PascalCase for all component names, file names, and folder names, except for shadcn components which are added automatically via the CLI and are excluded from this rule.

6. Avoid inline styles unless they are dynamic or context-dependent; use Tailwind CSS classes for styling consistency.

7. Always define prop types or interfaces explicitly for clarity and maintainability.

8. Avoid using the any type — instead, use unknown with type narrowing or proper type annotations.

9. Design components to be reusable and self-contained.

10. Split components into smaller subcomponents if they exceed 100–150 lines of code.

11. Prefer function declarations with explicitly typed props for better type inference and readability.
